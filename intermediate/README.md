- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup with try-with-resources
- **Exception Design**: Creating meaningful custom exception hierarchies
- **Debugging Skills**: Stack trace analysis and root cause identification
- **API Design**: Method signatures with appropriate exception declarations

### File I/O
- **Stream Concepts**: Understanding byte vs character streams
- **Resource Management**: Proper file handle cleanup
- **Performance Optimization**: Buffering strategies for large files
- **Data Persistence**: Object serialization for state preservation
- **Modern APIs**: NIO.2 advantages over legacy I/O classes

### Multithreading

- **Deadlock Prevention**: Safe resource acquisition patterns
- **Async Programming**: Non-blocking operations with CompletableFuture

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Java Features Demonstrated

### Modern Java Features
- **Try-with-resources** (Java 7+): Automatic resource management
- **Lambda expressions** (Java 8+): Functional programming constructs
- **Stream API** (Java 8+): Declarative data processing
- **CompletableFuture** (Java 8+): Asynchronous programming
- **Switch expressions** (Java 14+): Modern control flow
- **Records** (Java 14+): Immutable data carriers
- **Virtual threads** (Java 21+): Lightweight concurrency

### Design Patterns
- **Producer-Consumer**: Inter-thread communication pattern
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven programming
- **Strategy Pattern**: Algorithm selection at runtime
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation abstraction
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single instance management

### Best Practices
- **Resource Management**: Always close resources (files, streams, connections)
- **Exception Handling**: Catch specific exceptions, avoid catching Exception
- **Thread Safety**: Use concurrent collections for shared data
- **Performance**: Profile before optimizing, measure actual bottlenecks
- **Code Organization**: Separate concerns, single responsibility principle

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OutOfMemoryError with large files**
   - Use buffered streams for large file operations
   - Process files in chunks rather than loading entirely
   - Consider memory-mapped files for very large datasets

2. **ConcurrentModificationException**
   - Use iterator.remove() instead of collection.remove() during iteration
   - Use concurrent collections for multi-threaded access
   - Create defensive copies when needed

3. **Deadlock in multithreaded code**
   - Always acquire locks in the same order
   - Use timeout-based lock acquisition
   - Prefer higher-level concurrency utilities

4. **Resource leaks**
   - Always use try-with-resources for AutoCloseable objects
   - Properly shutdown ExecutorService instances
   - Close database connections and streams

### Performance Tips

1. **Collections Performance**
   - ArrayList: Fast random access, slow insertion/deletion in middle
   - LinkedList: Fast insertion/deletion, slow random access
   - HashMap: O(1) average lookup, TreeMap: O(log n) sorted lookup

2. **I/O Performance**
   - Use BufferedReader/Writer for character-based I/O
   - Use NIO.2 Files class for modern file operations
   - Consider memory-mapped files for large file processing

3. **Threading Performance**
   - Size thread pools based on task characteristics (CPU vs I/O bound)
   - Use virtual threads for I/O-intensive applications (Java 21+)
   - Minimize lock contention with concurrent data structures
